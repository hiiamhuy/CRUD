Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

one thing that took a long time was the Number/parseInt. Danial ended up looking at my saving section and telling me what you helped him with. 
	reviews.set("rating", Number($("#rating").raty('score')));

	please stick with 

	reviews.save(null, {
		success: function() {
				//Do something
					}
	});
	return false
});

	Alex method works if there is only one. Spent a little bit more figuring out why it didn't go through.
